# Checkmate.ai
Personalized chess coach using lichess.org API and various LLMs. 

**Idea: **
I've played almost 10,000 chess matches on Lichess.org and can export the match data from the online application. There are already tons of analytics features in Lichess, but as a casual player who just enjoys playing 3+ blitz....I do not have the time or desire to study the game at the level of a more dedicated player. Learning the syntax of chess match analysis (unnatural language) is something thats hard to parse, and for years this problem has been solved by running match data through various algorithms to help improve more serious players. 

**Desired Goal: **
There is an API address associated with my account. I want to create an application that uses an LLM to analyze the data and explain the trends in my gameplay in colloquial terms. I don't want to sift through countless blogs and diagrams online to figure out what went wrong. I don't want to get mired in the technical names of openings and defense. I want to quickly understand the general theme of my gameplay, and discuss in real time different strategic approaches. 

Image would show the current "Gem" in Gemini 2.5 Flash. Where it can play with a user.

This is promising, as the diagram looks like it is from Lichess.org. And, this new app will be able to generate diagrams like the one here during the conversation with the user.
